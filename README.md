# Enriching Ontology-based Data Management with Multidimensional Modeling

**Anonymous Repository â€“ Supplementary Material**

This repository accompanies the paper *"Enriching Ontology-based Data Management with Multidimensional Modeling"*. It provides supplementary material, including implementation details and a detailed running example, which expands and clarifies the concepts introduced in the paper.

## Overview

This work extends the traditional Ontology-Based Data Management (OBDM) paradigm by introducing a formal framework for modeling and reasoning over multidimensional data. Our framework integrates cubes, hierarchies, and views as intentional, ontologically grounded objects, and supports reasoning services such as:

- Cube and hierarchy coherence
- Intentional aggregation
- Holistic query answering that spans both analytical and domain-level data

## Implementation

The framework has been implemented as an extension of the [Mastro](https://obdasystems.com) OBDM system. Mastro supports OWL ontologies, SPARQL queries, and R2RML or XML-based mapping definitions.

We built our extension within the **INTERSTAT** project, which focuses on semantic integration of statistical, territorial, and administrative data. The showcased use case, called **School for You (S4Y)**, involves cross-country data integration (Italy and France) on school attendance and educational services.

## User Interface

We enhanced the **Monolith** interface (the user-facing component of Mastro) with support for multidimensional constructs:

- Graphical editors for views, hierarchies, and cubes
- Drop-down menus and SPARQL editors for defining cube logic
- Interactive filtering and data slicing
- Visual feedback on cube aggregation results
